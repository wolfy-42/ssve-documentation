# 1. Introduction

FPGA design is highly dynamic, and that dynamism demands an equally flexible verification environment. This simple SystemVerilog-based verification environment (SSVE) is an attempt to deliver precisely that: a lean, adaptable framework that retains the power and flexibility of SystemVerilog while stripping away the unnecessary complexity often associated with heavy-weight frameworks such as Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). It also aims to provide a universal platform that can be easily adapted to different simulators and operating systems — giving engineers the freedom and flexibility to verify FPGA designs in a way that best suits their tools and workflows.
