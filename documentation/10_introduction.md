# 1. Introduction



## 1.1 FPGA Developers Super Stars

FPGA design engineers are now considered the top-tier professionals in electronics design, outpacing their ASIC counterparts. High-end FPGAs now present the same technical challenges, that were once the exclusive realm of ASIC experts. Yet they combine this sophistication with unmatched flexibility, lower cost, and faster time-to-market. FPGA design demands far broader and deeper expertise than ASIC work, blending what would be multiple ASIC‑specialist roles into one — system architecture, timing closure, floorplanning, IP integration, HDL coding, and more. While ASIC engineers often focus narrowly on one piece of the flow (e.g. back‑end, DFT, synthesis), FPGA designers must master the entire pipeline, and then some more. That makes them not only among the most versatile engineers but also often more capable than their ASIC peers, tackling comparable or greater complexity with fewer resources.

**Key skills of FPGA designers include:**

**FPGA-Specific Tools and Methodologies:**  Mastery of hardware description languages (VHDL, Verilog), FPGA  development environments (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, Intel Quartus, etc.), algorithm development (C++, Matlab Simulink), simulation tools (ModelSim), and synthesis and debugging  workflows

**ASIC Architecture, Design, Verification, Backend, and Testing:** Deep knowledge of digital circuit design, verification methodologies, and the complete ASIC development flow

**Advanced DSP Algorithm Development:**  Expertise in architecting and implementing sophisticated digital signal  processing algorithms within FPGA platforms, including real-time signal  processing, high-speed data path design, and integration with radio or image processing systems

**Software Design and Testing:**  Proficiency in programming languages (such as C/C++, Python, and scripting languages), and the ability to develop and test embedded software that interfaces with hardware

**Laboratory Skills:** Strong hands-on abilities in lab environments, including hardware bring-up, debugging, validation, and the use of test equipment for characterizing and troubleshooting FPGA-based systems



## 1.2 What is FPGA



An FPGA is a type of integrated circuit that works like a highly flexible version of an ASIC. Unlike a fixed-function ASIC, an FPGA can be programmed and reconfigured to implement different hardware behaviors, which is why it’s often described as a “soft ASIC."

### 1.2.1 FPGA design is essentially the same as ASIC (chip) design, but it is more complex.

In an ASIC project, the work is divided among many specialists: one or more architects, a team of RTL designers to implement and integrate all modules, specialists for timing closure, CDC and formal-verification engineers, a physical design team for layout and tape-out preparation, and a large verification team, often comparable in size to the RTL team, to run full‑chip simulations.

* an FPGA designer == an ASIC team

For an FPGA project, a **single engineer is often expected to cover most of these roles and a few more:** architecture development, RTL design, timing closure, CDC checks, module and chip level simulations, as well as some software development and integration, data‑intensive processing such as DSP or AI, and hardware bring‑up and lab debug. Many tasks may be simpler than in an ASIC flow, but deep specialization is less common; the typical FPGA engineer must be competent across a wide range of technologies and skills. In that sense, being an FPGA designer is  demanding, and it is fair to say that FPGA engineers are among the most competent, skilled and versatile designers in the industry.
